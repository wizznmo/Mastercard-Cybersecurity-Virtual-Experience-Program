# Security Vulnerability Analysis Report

## Mastercard Cybersecurity Virtual Experience Program - August 2024

### Prepared by: Alamin Elyass

## 1. Introduction

This report presents the findings of the phishing simulation conducted during the Mastercard Cybersecurity Virtual Experience Program. The goal of the simulation was to identify which areas within the organization are most vulnerable to phishing attacks and to develop targeted security awareness training based on these findings.

## 2. Phishing Simulation Overview

- **Phishing Email Design:** A realistic phishing email was created to simulate a security threat. The email was designed to appear legitimate, incorporating best practices in phishing techniques such as contextual relevance, masked hyperlinks, and a professional tone.
- **Simulation Execution:** The phishing email was sent to a selected group of employees across various departments to assess their susceptibility to phishing attacks.

## 3. Analysis of Results

- **Employee Response Rate:** The phishing email had a significant response rate, indicating a potential vulnerability within certain areas of the organization.
- **Departmental Analysis:** The analysis revealed that the HR department had the highest susceptibility to phishing attacks, with a large percentage of employees interacting with the phishing email.

## 4. Recommendations

Based on the analysis, it is recommended that targeted security awareness training be conducted for the HR department. This training should focus on:

- **Recognizing Phishing Emails:** Educating employees on common phishing tactics and how to spot them.
- **Understanding the Risks:** Highlighting the potential consequences of falling victim to phishing attacks, both for the individual and the organization.
- **Best Practices:** Providing practical tips for maintaining security in daily tasks, such as verifying email sources and avoiding clicking on suspicious links.

## 5. Implementation

- **Training Session:** A security awareness training session was developed and conducted for the HR department. This session included a slideshow presentation covering the key areas of phishing awareness and prevention.

## 6. Conclusion

The phishing simulation and subsequent analysis have provided valuable insights into the organizationâ€™s vulnerabilities. The targeted training for the HR department is expected to significantly improve their ability to identify and respond to phishing attempts, thereby enhancing overall organizational security.
