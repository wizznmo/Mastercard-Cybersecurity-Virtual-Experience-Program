# Mastercard Cybersecurity Virtual Experience Program - August 2024

## Overview

This repository contains the work I completed during the Mastercard Cybersecurity Virtual Experience Program on Forage in August 2024. As part of this program, I served as an analyst on Mastercardâ€™s Security Awareness Team. My responsibilities included identifying and reporting security threats, such as phishing, and analyzing which areas of the business were most vulnerable to these threats. Additionally, I developed and conducted targeted training for the Human Resources (HR) department to improve their security awareness.

## Key Tasks

### 1. **Phishing Simulation**

- **Objective:** Create a realistic and convincing phishing email to be used in a simulation aimed at assessing the vulnerability of employees to phishing attacks.
- **Outcome:** Developed a contextual and believable phishing email, incorporating techniques such as masking hyperlinks, ensuring correct spelling and grammar, and adding legitimacy to the message. The email was designed to encourage user interaction, helping to identify potential security weaknesses within the organization.

### 2. **Security Vulnerability Analysis**

- **Objective:** Analyze the results of the phishing simulation to determine which parts of the organization were most susceptible to phishing attacks.
- **Outcome:** Identified the HR department as a weak point within the organization regarding phishing awareness and susceptibility. This analysis provided critical insights into the areas requiring immediate attention and improvement.

### 3. **Security Awareness Training**

- **Objective:** Develop and implement a security awareness training program tailored to the HR department based on the findings from the phishing simulation.
- **Outcome:** Conducted a training session using a detailed slideshow presentation, focusing on recognizing phishing emails, understanding the consequences of falling victim to such threats, and best practices for maintaining security in everyday tasks. This training aimed to enhance the HR department's ability to identify and respond to phishing attempts effectively.

## Skills Developed

- **Problem-Solving:** Addressed complex cybersecurity challenges by developing realistic phishing simulations and training programs.
- **Data Analysis:** Analyzed the effectiveness of phishing simulations to identify organizational weaknesses.
- **Data Presentation:** Created and presented a comprehensive security awareness training program tailored to specific departmental needs.
- **Cybersecurity Awareness:** Gained practical experience in identifying security threats and implementing preventive measures.

## Conclusion

This program confirmed my strong interest in pursuing a career in cybersecurity, specifically within a Security Awareness team. I am excited to apply the skills and knowledge I have gained in this program to real-world scenarios in a professional setting.
